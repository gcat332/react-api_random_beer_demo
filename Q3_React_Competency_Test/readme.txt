This is a part of my practice program for learning Type-Script and NodeJS in subject of comunication between React and API created in 2nd quiz via axios, useState, useEffect and useRef

App-Basic is my main code, api folder is including of my API application while web-app folder including of my react web-application

for API
Type-Script file is located in ./App_Basic/src

server.ts / server.js => server backend via nodeJS and Express, connect to mongoDB by mongoose.
./models/beer.ts / beer.js => mongoose schema setup for beer API

beer.jsx => React app to get data from random beer API
beer.css => CSS for beer web-app

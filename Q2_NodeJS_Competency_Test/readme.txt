This is a part of my practice program for learning Type-Script and NodeJS in subject of API creation with GET, POST method

App-Basic is my main code, while I_TRY_TO_CODE is my practice with API.

Type-Script file is located in ./App_Basic/src
NodeJS file is located in ./App_Basic/dist

server.ts / server.js => server backend via nodeJS and Express, connect to mongoDB by mongoose.
./models/beer.ts / beer.js => mongoose schema setup for beer API

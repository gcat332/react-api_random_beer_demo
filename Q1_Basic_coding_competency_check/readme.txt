This is a part of my practice program for learning Type-Script and NodeJS in subject of Test-Unit, Accept argrument via CLI

Type-Script file is located in ./src
NodeJS file is located in ./dist

main.ts / main.js => main funtion that takes 2 alphanumeric strings and returns a sum of the two string as a
string.
app.ts / app.js => CLI to accept the arguments for the sum function and display error
main.test.js => Test-Unit for main function.
